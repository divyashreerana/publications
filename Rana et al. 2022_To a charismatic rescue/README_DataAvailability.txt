The available data and code has been used in the manuscript titled "To a charismatic rescue: Designing a blueprint to steer Fishing Cat conservation for safeguarding Indian wetlands" with doi:https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jnc.2022.126225
The description of attached files are as follows:
1. Code_for_FC_HSM_Connectivity_analysis.R: This is the R script for analysing FC data for HSM and Omnidirectional connectivity analysis. Instructions and descriptions have been annotated within.
2. Occ_thin_Ind.csv: This file contains presence locations of the Fishing Cat
3. PB1_Ind.csv: This file contains the locations for Fishing Cat presence as well as background points used in the maxent models. Background points were sampled using the shiny app interface of the wallace package in R, for which code is not available in the R script.
4. Rasters: Contains all the rasters used as predictors for habitat suitability
5. Connectivity: Contains the resistance file generated from the habitat suitability raster using QGIS. All concurrent connectivity analysis files are generated and stored in this folder during code execution.
