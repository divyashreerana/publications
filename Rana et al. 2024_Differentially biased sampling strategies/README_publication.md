Abstract/Highlights: 
• Species distribution models are important tools in ecological research.
• Exploration of the influence of sampling extent on different data types is limited.
• Validation with independent data is crucial.
• Mismatch in predictive extent and sampling range can lead to erroneous results.
• Data with pseudo-absences sensitive is more sensitive to changes in sampling extent.
